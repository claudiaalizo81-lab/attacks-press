			<p class="intro">147 incidents against the press covering immigration related issues, like ICE raids, protests around the agency’s facilities or demonstrations against Donald Trump’s policies in this matter were tracked by U.S Press Freedom Tracker between the beginning of the year and October. 
			</p>
			<!-- Regular body paragraph -->
			<p>
				This number is by far the highest recorded in any of the previous years in this category, since the non-partisan news website started tracking incidents against the press in 2017. Between 2017 and 2024, these events accounted for 47 in total. 
			</p>
			<p> The highest number of events were recorded in California, with 101 incidents, followed by Illinois (29) and Oregon (5). Other states include New York (4) , Washington (2), Kentucky(2), Georgia(2), Pennsylvania (1) and Indiana (1). ICE raids prompted backlash during the summer in Los Angeles, leading to protests and demonstrations. Trump’s administration has since deployed National Guard Troops to this city and others around the US to crack down on such protests.</p>
		<p>U.S Press Freedom Tracker grouped the types of attacks in five categories, but an incident can fall under more than one. Categories include Arrest/Criminal Charge; Assault; Border Stops; Equipment Damage and Equipment Search or seizure. </p>
